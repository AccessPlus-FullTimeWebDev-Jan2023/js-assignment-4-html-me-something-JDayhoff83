            <p>My first time visiting Europe was a whirlwind weeklong trip across three cities in late July of 2019.  I'd been preparing with some minor French lessons, looking into the sights that I was hoping to see and had prepared all my lodging and travel between the three cities.  The first step was getting onto my first international flight from St. Louis, Missouri to Paris, France with a connection in Toronto, Canada.</p>

            <h2>Paris, France</h2>

            <p>Despite the long flight across time zones and being jet-lagged, I arrived early in the day in Paris and started my sight-seeing.  I met my husband at the train station and we proceeded to find our AirBnb where we dropped our stuff and went to our first destination, The Louvre.  It was amazing to see all the art in person that I had seen in textbooks growing up.  Consecutive days were spent enjoying the gardens at Versailles, bike-riding through the city streets along the river Seine, spending an afternoon relaxing under the shadow of the Eiffel Tower and finally ending with a climb to the beautiful Sacre-Coeur.

            <h2>London, England</h2>

            <p>We left Paris bound for London on a commuter train, which also happened to be my first train ride.We arrived in London, checked into our hostel and proceeded to try the local cuisine: fish &amp; chips and bangers &amp; mash. Our time there was short but we explored The National Gallery, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, and London Bridge.</p>

            <p>Finally we flew out of London setting down into a cool, cloudy Dublin.  We took public transportation to our hostel and then started exploring the city.  A few small taverns under our belt we meandered through the city, visiting historical churches and landmarks, perhaps most notably Trinity College.  With our time spent, along with a good amount of savings, we boarded my second long international flight and returned to the warm comfort of a humid summer in St. Louis.  I was home again, glad for the experiences of my first European Vacation.</p>
